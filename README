Color commentary: the bit about todo lists is kind of funny. I like to organize and track my tasks, even for my hobbies, but my approach to task management is based on the Getting Things Done methodology, where tasks are done based on a combination of when, where, and how they need to be done combined with how much time that task takes, so I also answered that I don't have specific todos for a given day (deadline/scheduled tasks notwithstanding).

My ideal workplace is one where I get to do lots of knowledge tasks and tackle problems with at least a few people to bounce ideas off of. I don't mind doing get-togethers on a fairly frequent basis and I usually make friends at work. I get a lot of enjoyment out of having to learn a totally new technology or approach and apply it to a problem the company is dealing with, and I like the idea of having to switch tasks and staying nimble on my day-to-day.
